Hi [Mat Griffiths!](https://medium.com/u/aa9862fa5d3) I have been able to do all of those things except bring your breakfast. Does Friday work for you? /joke

My solution relies on nested symbols and shared naming conventions:

![](img\1__0sUd6OWJfZd5GSwpJU1E2Q.gif)

For buttons with the same text color, I only change the “base” color.

For buttons with different text colors, I change the symbol that my button is using altogether — overrides will stick around so you may have to reset the button base, if you’ve overridden it previously!

Does that help?
