Great post! I love seeing how other people are trying to solve this problem. Repositioning and resizing buttons has always been difficult, especially when you’re trying to keep styles consistent across button types.

I tried my hand at solving this problem a few months ago: [https://blog.desandoval.net/sketch-app-a-better-responsive-button-using-symbols-53df1b61a47a](https://blog.desandoval.net/sketch-app-a-better-responsive-button-using-symbols-53df1b61a47a)

I like that your approach doesn’t require me to use a specific function to change the text, if I want to keep the padding enforced.

Thanks for posting!
