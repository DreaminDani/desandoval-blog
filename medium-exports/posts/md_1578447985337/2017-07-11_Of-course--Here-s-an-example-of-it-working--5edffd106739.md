Of course! Here’s an example of it working:

![](img\1__7t4OoYdT7eFrLlMveIMYMQ.gif)

Make sure your icon is “pinned” to the left and it is set to “fix width”:

And set up your text as I showed in the blog post (“pinned to all sides”):

Then, in your instantiation of that symbol, use the CMD+J shortcut to change the text with the Button plugin:

Notice that the 8px left-padding and the 16px right-padding stays constant, no matter how long the text.

… you can also switch out the icon with any same-sized icon symbol:

Hope that helps!
