My buttons did not break in 47.1 but I think some peopleâ€™s did. I noticed in the Sketch 48 release notes that they mentioned:

*   **Symbol Scaling:** Symbol instances can now be scaled using the Scale command, independently from the Symbol master.

So perhaps this fixes your issue. One thing to check is whether or not your button text is set to Auto:

Hope that helps!
