You’ll have to be a little hacky because the button plugin doesn’t know about your text symbol’s text. What I recommend is to create a hidden text (opacity 0%) in your button symbol:

You can then use the CMD+J keys to stretch out the button as you update the hidden text. Paste (or reenter) that same text into the symbol override to get the desired text:

This will allow you to change the overrides as you’d like:

Hope the helps with your use-case!
