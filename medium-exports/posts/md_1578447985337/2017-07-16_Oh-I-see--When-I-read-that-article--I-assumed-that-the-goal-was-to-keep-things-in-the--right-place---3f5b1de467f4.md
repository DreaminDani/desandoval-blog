Oh I see. When I read that article, I assumed that the goal was to keep things in the “right place” when you resized buttons (as shown in [https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1\*QC4m3HEyByt6WuwJvH7Blg.gif](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*QC4m3HEyByt6WuwJvH7Blg.gif)).

It seems what you want is a way to keep the button size consistent as you change the elements within. I don’t think my hack works for this :/ Sorry!
