## Development
1. [Install Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/)
2. `yarn` (or `npm install`)
3. `yarn local` (or `npm run local`)

Ensure that files generated via rollup in `/static` are committed. Otherwise, svelte components wont ship with hugo.

## Deployment
Currently deployed on netlify. Can be deployed anywhere using `hugo`
