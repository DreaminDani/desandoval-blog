Intro

In this series, I walk through the steps (and tools) it took to...
1. [Research a tech stack that made it easy to comply to web standards](/posts/rebuilding-my-site-1)
2. Get Hugo up and running and styling the home page **(this post)**
3. Migrate my blog from Medium and my portfolio from my old site
4. Style the blog and portfolio using SCSS
5. Design and build out the portfolio browsing experience
6. Migrate the only dynamic content on my site, the "I am..." page
7. Deploy to netlify, set up DNS and redirect rules
8. (Cross-)Post content on others' sites and get feedback on drafts

## A Hugo "Hello World"
Step-by-step, getting the project set up. Choosing the theme (#blank)

## From zero to hero: the home page (S)CSS
With screenshots, show the styling as it gets added - layer by layer.

## Next up: the great migration
In my next post, I'll discuss the tradeoffs of hosting my blog on Medium, how I exported and converted the posts into standard markdown, and mourning the loss of my custom markdown parser.

**Spoiler alert:** It turns out, anything you could do with a custom markdown parser can usually be done much more easily with the tools built into a static site generator.
