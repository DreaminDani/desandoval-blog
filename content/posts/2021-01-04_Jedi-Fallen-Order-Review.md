**Spoiler Alert** I really can't review this game without getting into spoilers. If you'd like a spoiler-free review, I'd recommend [Kotaku\'s article on the game](https://kotaku.com/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-the-kotaku-review-1839940185). But, if you're reading this and you're interested in my opinion, I'd recommend playing the game. It's really only a dozen hours to play through, no more than 20 if you're a completionist.

## Living in the past

[Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order](https://www.ea.com/games/starwars/jedi-fallen-order) takes place between Episode III and IV. Throughout the game, your character, Cal Kestis, regains his force powers through flashbacks to training with his master, Jaro Tapal. This back-and-forth sets up an interesting "before and after" emotional context that really sets the tone of the game.

Before the Order 66, the Jedi are free to train, dive deeper into the mysteries of the Force, and protect the galaxy from the evils it imposes on itself. After the purge, they're scrounging to survive - narrowly avoiding Inquisitors and helping the nascent rebellion as it fails to make a dent in the ever-growing Empire.

As a boy, Cal Kestis can make mistakes. He can fail and get back up again, sometimes with only a gentle scolding from his master. In the present, where most of the game takes place, a mistake can get you captured, thrown into an arena, and leave you fighting for your life against a managerie of monsters.

In the same way, the Jedi in Fallen Order are in a precarious position. In the past, failure maybe meant a political snafu or a slipping of the balance in favor of the Sith. Jedi were used to failure and used it as a way to learn and become better in their practice. Yet this acceptance of fate and the inevitable consequences of failure is what made them so vulnerable. Their trust of that, at the end of the day, people would do what was right, is what led them with their back turns to the clones they fought alongside.

Faced with this mistake, Cal blames himself for not being stronger, or not having more courage... until he meets Taron Malicos.

## Those who do not learn history...

When I first landed on Dathos, I was totally underleveled and gave up immediately.
