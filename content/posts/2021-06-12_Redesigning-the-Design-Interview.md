At some companies (like google) this can take up to 8-12 weeks (see link to recent blog post)

## Problems with the "standard" interview loop

- inequitable (time, requires a portfolio, etc.)
- can feel like a waste of time when a candidate gets rejected
- portfolio presentation is usually judged by at least one non-designer. Prioritizes things that look good over the actual design process (quote from spool here?)

## Why do we do this to each other?

Problems the interview loop is trying to solve

- Bad "fits"
    - Do they share our values?
    - can they resolve conflicts?
    - can we afford them?
- Can the designers really design?
    - break down problems
    - prioritize based on user needs
    - respond well to feedback
    - ship something real (work with devs, adjust to business constraints, etc.)
- connecting candidate(s) to headcount
    - what skills do they have already (UX? Visual? Platform-specific expertise?)
    - what skills do they want to learn/grow in to? (IC? Manager? New design skillsets?)

## What we're trying

At Chipper Cash, we took a step back and framed these problems in a way that makes sense to us designers, a "how might we" statement:

> How might we create a more **equitable** hiring process that **respects candidates' time** while ensuring that we hire designers with the **skills, values and interests** needed for the roles we're trying to fill?
