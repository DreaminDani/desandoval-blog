For those working from home for the first time or (like me) are returning to work from home due to COVID-19, you may not realize that one of the most important things you can do to stay focused is to be flexible and kind to yourself.

After scrambling to find a space where your background didn't give your entire life away, you may have spent the better part of this week reading the hundreds of articles with advice on how to work from home effectively. Despite working from home for most of 2018-2019, I found myself doing the same thing - attempting to find comfort in the "tech tips" and "survival hacks" that filled my news feed. I'll link to the ones I liked at the end of this post.

I noticed, however, that these articles didn't cover one of the most important things that I learned while working from home. It wasn't the Pomodoro Technique or GTD that kept me on task, nor was it a sleep-cycle app or mid-afternoon nap that gave me energy. **To remain productive, sane and (sometimes even) joyful, I had to recognize that I wasn't perfect.**

The list below describes how to create release valves for the pressures that build up throughout the day - the expectations that you set for yourself that you may not live up to.

## 1. Make your routine flexible

## 2. Start work at the same time, let your team know when that changes

## 3. Pair with others often

## 4. Time yourself forwards before timing yourself backwards

## 5. Take breaks, and remind others when you're on one

Review your habits. Take stock of your goals. Ask your team to keep you accountable?
